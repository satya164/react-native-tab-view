        You must provide a way to reproduce the problem. If you don't provide a repro, the issue will be closed automatically after a specific period.

        - Either re-create the bug on [Snack](https://snack.expo.dev) or link to a GitHub repository with code that reproduces the bug.
        - Explain how to run the example app and any steps that we need to take to reproduce the issue from the example app.
        - Keep the repro code as simple as possible, with the minimum amount of code required to repro the issue.
        - Before reporting an issue, make sure you are on latest version of the package.
        - If you are having an issue with your machine or build tools, the issue belongs on another repository as that is outside of the scope of the library.
